# ``BbAppModuleSet``

Dependency injection container for application modules.

## Overview

The BbAppModuleSet library provides a centralized dependency injection container that holds all core application modules. It bundles together content sources, content stores, push notification services, status bar management, configuration, intent routing, and other essential services into a single, easily passed-around object. This enables clean dependency management and facilitates testing by allowing module replacement.
